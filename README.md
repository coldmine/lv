If your OS is Windows, you need to install Git Windows. (If you don't have already.)

Download git from https://git-scm.com/download/win

For other OS, I expect you have it.

Type `git` in terminal for check.

Download go from https://golang.org/dl/

Follow the installation steps. then,

### Run lv
